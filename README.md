# RP-Project_Robstacles
Our project consists of implementing a planner that follows an A* algorythm that allows us to perform a safe path; and a path follower that with the information provided by the planner allows us to reach the destination.
This project is executed for the examination of robot programming. 
Following the instructions given to us by our professor, the project will be structured in the following phases: 
- Implementation of the A* algorithm in C++;
- Creation of a map using ROS's map_server service;
- Simulations in ROS.
