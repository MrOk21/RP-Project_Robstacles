# RP-Project_Robstacles
Our project's objective is to build a wheeled robot that will implement an A* heuristic to  avoid obstacles in the space and integrate it in ROS. Student Andrea Di Francesco will work on the implementation of the A* heuristic. Student Vincenzo Maria Vitale will work on the building of the ROS workspace, and on the robot system's integration in ROS. Student Enrico Fazzi will work on the Robot's hardware and control.
