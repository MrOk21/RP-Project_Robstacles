# RP-Project_Robstacles
Our project consists of implementing a planner that follows an A* algorithm that allows us to perform a safe path; and a path follower that with the information provided by the planner allows us to reach the destination.
This project is executed for the robot programming course, held by Professor Giorgio Grisetti. 
Following the instructions given to us by our professor, the project will be structured in the following phases: 
- Implementation of the A* algorithm in C++;
- Implementation of an RVIZ interface, where the path is published and visualized accordingly;
- Once the path is visualized, a rigid body follows it at a specific rate, starting from the initial to the final configuration.
